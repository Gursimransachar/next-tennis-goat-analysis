# ðŸŽ¾ Next Tennis GOAT: Big 3 vs Next Gen (SQL + Tableau Project)

This project analyzes whether the rising stars in men's tennis â€” such as Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner â€” are on pace to match the dominance of the Big 3 (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic). Using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visual storytelling, we compare title counts, win rates, surface performance, and more.
