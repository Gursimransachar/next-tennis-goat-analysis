While Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic have defined the last two decades, this project explores whether the current crop of players like Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Holger Rune, and others are on a similar trajectory.\n","\n","### Objective: \n","\n","This project explores the ongoing debate in the tennis world: who could be the 'Next GOAT' after the era of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic — the Big 3. Leveraging ATP match data from 2000 to 2025, the early performance of emerging stars such as Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner was analyzed, focusing on comparable metrics such as title wins, win percentages, Top 10 victories, surface specialization, and head-to-head records. The goal is to determine if the 'Next Gen' is on track to match or surpass the dominance of the Big 3. This is a very basic starting point to explore this ambitious question, with room to scale the model further.\n","Methodology\n","A dataset of ATP matches from 2020–2025 was used. The analysis was performed using SQL for data filtering, Python for preprocessing, and Tableau for visual analytics.\n","\n","### Steps: ###\n","1. Filtered players who reached or won finals in Grand Slams, Masters 1000, and ATP Finals (2020–2025).\n","2. Removed Djokovic to isolate new generation competitors.\n","3. Added manually collected birthdates to compute player age in each match.\n","4. Identified players aged 18–24 with at least one major title.\n","5.
